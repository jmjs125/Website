            I'm a passionate and driven game developer with a solid foundation in Unreal Engine 4 and hands-on experience with both Blueprints and C++. My journey in game development has been shaped through various Game Jams, where I’ve honed my creativity, problem-solving, and collaboration skills.
            I’ve developed third-person games using Blueprints and worked closely with artists and designers, which has strengthened my ability to thrive in team-based environments. I also have experience with tools like Jira for project management, and I designed and built this website myself using HTML.
            I’m always eager to learn, improve, and bring imaginative ideas to life through engaging gameplay experiences.
